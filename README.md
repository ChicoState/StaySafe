## Environment Setup
1. Install Docker Desktop from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/) or the standalone Docker Compose from your package manager:
    ```bash
    # For Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives
    sudo apt install docker-compose

    # For Arch and derivatives
    sudo pacman -S docker-compose

    # For macOS with Homebrew
    brew install docker-compose
    ```

2. Clone this repository and navigate to it:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ChicoState/StaySafe.git
    cd StaySafe
    ```

3. Build and start the containers.
    ```bash
    docker compose up 
    ```

4. Access the app via a web browser:
    * Frontend at http://localhost:3000/
    * Backend at http://localhost:8080/

## Environment Troubleshooting

If you run into issues with the environment, try running `docker-clean.sh` or use the following:

```bash
docker rm staysafe_front staysafe_back staysafe_mongo
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```

If the above doesn't resolve the issue, and the issue appears to be related to npm dependencies:

```bash
rm backend/package-lock.json frontend/node_modules
rm -r backend/node_modules frontend/node_modules
docker rm staysafe_front staysafe_back staysafe_mongo
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```
