#### Docker Troubleshooting

If you run into issues with the Docker environment, try running `docker-clean.sh` or use the following:

```bash
docker rm staysafe_front
docker rm staysafe_back
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

If the above doesn't resolve the issue, and the issue appears to be related to npm dependencies:

```bash
rm backend/package-lock.json
rm -r backend/node_modules
rm frontend/package-lock.json
rm -r frontend/node_modules
docker rm staysafe_front
docker rm staysafe_back
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```
